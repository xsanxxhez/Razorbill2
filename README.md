# Razorbill — Geospatial AI Analysis Platform (Demo)

A raw, early-stage demo of a geospatial AI analysis platform for **quantitative analysts and quant traders** — built to visualize multi-source data layers, run research-grade analysis pipelines, and turn unstructured inputs into actionable geospatial objects.

## Pitch

Razorbill explores a simple idea: markets, people, climate, and infrastructure are spatial systems — and many “edges” appear when you look at data geographically.

The platform combines a 3D globe (“Razorball”) with an NLP-driven AI engine that can interpret requests and translate disparate inputs into geospatial layers. The long-term vision is a research environment where analysts can ingest vast datasets, test hypotheses, and refine probabilistic signals to maximize expected ROI.

## Demo highlights

- **3D geospatial visualization (“Razorball”)**  
  Render and explore any supported layer as real geospatial primitives (points/lines/polygons) on an interactive globe.

- **Data layer exploration**  
  Overlay and inspect multiple thematic layers and drill into entities with contextual metadata.

- **Pipeline-first analysis concept**  
  Designed around connected pipelines: ingest → normalize → analyze → visualize, enabling large-scale research flows and statistical edge discovery.

- **Web3 privacy-preserving data aggregation (planned)**  
  A future module aims to serve as an independent data aggregator sourced directly from individual contributors, designed to preserve contributor anonymity when providing sensitive data without legal consequences.

## Disclaimer

- **Prototype quality:** Razorbill is a raw demo/proof-of-concept and is not production-ready.
- **No financial advice:** This project is for research and engineering exploration only and does not constitute investment advice.
- **Project status:** The project is currently **frozen** due to maintenance and funding constraints that are not accessible to the co-founders at this time.
